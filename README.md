# WiFiCallBypass

This script enables **tunneling of Wi-Fi Calling traffic over an SSH tunnel**.  
It is useful if your mobile provider blocks Wi-Fi Calling outside your home country (for example, due to IP geoblocking).

## Why Use This?

Some mobile providers restrict Wi-Fi Calling to users within their home country by blocking connections from foreign IP addresses.  
By tunneling your Wi-Fi Calling traffic through an SSH server in your home country, you can bypass these restrictions and use Wi-Fi Calling from anywhere.

## Features

- Tunnels Wi-Fi Calling traffic over SSH
- Helps bypass IP-based geoblocking by mobile providers

## Usage

1. **Ensure you have an SSH server in your home country.**  
   This is necessary to tunnel your Wi-Fi Calling traffic through a trusted location.

2. **Connect your phone to the Wi-Fi network you created (AP).**  
   For example, you can use a tool like [linux-wifi-hotspot](https://github.com/lakinduakash/linux-wifi-hotspot) to set up your access point.

3. **Run the script on your device or router.**  
    The script must be executed with root privileges.

4. **Specify required parameters when running the script:**  
   The script uses named parameters, so you can provide them in any order.  
   - `--mnc `: Mobile Network Code (e.g., `001`) of your provider, according to [https://www.mcc-mnc.com/](https://www.mcc-mnc.com/)
   - `--mcc `: Mobile Country Code (e.g., `228`) of your provider, according to [https://www.mcc-mnc.com/](https://www.mcc-mnc.com/)
   - `--ssh `: SSH connection string (e.g., `user@host`)
   - `--tmark `: (Optional) Firewall mark for TPROXY (default: `0x01`)

   **Example:**
   ```bash
   sudo ./WiFiCallBypass.sh --mnc 001 --mcc 228 --ssh user@your-ssh-server
   ```
   Or with a custom TPROXY mark:
   ```bash
   sudo ./WiFiCallBypass.sh --ssh user@your-ssh-server --mnc 001 --mcc 228 --tmark 0xAD
   ```

5. **Verify connectivity from your phone:**  
   - Check that Wi-Fi Calling is enabled and works as expected.

### Notes

- The script will automatically configure routing and policy rules for transparent proxying.

## Requirements

- sshuttle (or similar tunneling tool)
- Root privileges (required for network configuration)
